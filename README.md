Data Analytics Good revenues Poor reviews &lt;Smart Cube Case Study 2018>
A global restaurant search and discovery service provider CEO is in discussion with the COO, 
decided that they want to improve customer experience especially for those restaurants where they are not performing well. 
However the problem is that many of the restaurants listed provide good revenues. In lieu of which, 
the COO has decided to continue with the restaurants with bad reviews. 
The COO however wants to understand the reasons that cause a bad review and take appropriate actions.


Analytics questions
1) Identify the drivers of bad reviews across restaurants?
a. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in the data
b. Standardize data e.g. sales in USD
2) Analyze data and create more variables (if required) based on exploratory data analysis to support the 
variability in reviews across restaurants
3) Suggest modelling techniques based on the EDA done in step above to 
predict the solution in this particular case and apply one of these

Expected Output
1) Cleaned data containing newly created variables (if any) along with supporting reasoning on their qualification
2) EDA results in Excel table and one-liner description on potential hypothesis you may be testing
3) Modelling techniques used and results
4) Final insights/opinions presented in an MS PowerPoint presentation
Note- Output 1, 2, and 3 should be presented in MS-Excel file, with each tab answering the above questions


### This solution and it's explanation secured two of my student at IIM Shillong

We will try to find some driving force through important feature extraction that tree based algos like 
random forest and Xgboost does seamlessly.
